@inproceedings{Graus2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).Entity ranking, i.e., successfully positioning a relevant entity at the top of the ranking for a given query, is inherently difficult due to the potential mismatch between the entity's description in a knowledge base, and the way people refer to the entity when searching for it. To counter this issue we propose a method for constructing dynamic collective entity representations. We collect entity descriptions from a variety of sources and combine them into a single entity representation by learning to weight the content from different sources that are associated with an entity for optimal retrieval effectiveness. Our method is able to add new descriptions in real time and learn the best representation as time evolves so as to capture the dynamics of how people search entities. Incorporating dynamic description sources into dynamic collective entity representations improves retrieval effectiveness by 7{\%} over a state-of-the-art learning to rank baseline. Periodic retraining of the ranker enables higher ranking effectiveness for dynamic collective entity representations.},

@inproceedings{SIGIR:2001:Lavrenko,
abstract = {We explore the relation between classical probabilistic models of information retrieval and the emerging language modeling approaches. It has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of classical models is the need to estimate arelevance model: probabilities of words in the relevant class. We propose a novel technique for estimating these probabilities using the query alone. We demonstrate that our technique can produce highly accurate relevance models, addressing important notions of synonymy and polysemy. Our experiments show relevance models outperforming baseline language modeling systems on TREC retrieval and TDT tracking tasks. The main contribution of this work is an effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no training data.},

abstract = {This paper develops a general, formal framework for modeling term dependencies via Markov random fields. The model allows for arbitrary text features to be incorporated as evidence. In particular, we make use of features based on occurrences of single terms, ordered phrases, and unordered phrases. We explore full independence, sequential dependence, and full dependence variants of the model. A novel approach is developed to train the model that directly maximizes the mean average precision rather than maximizing the likelihood of the training data. Ad hoc retrieval experiments are presented on several newswire and web collections, including the GOV2 collection used at the TREC 2004 Terabyte Track. The results show significant improvements are possible by modeling dependencies, especially on the larger web collections.},

abstract = {A major challenge in Entity Linking (EL) is making effective use of contextual information to disambiguate mentions to Wikipedia that might refer to different entities in different contexts. The problem exacerbates with cross-lingual EL which involves linking mentions written in non-English documents to entries in the English Wikipedia: to compare textual clues across languages we need to compute similarity between textual fragments across languages. In this paper, we propose a neural EL model that trains fine-grained similarities and dissimilarities between the query and candidate document from multiple perspectives, combined with convolution and tensor networks. Further, we show that this English-trained system can be applied, in zero-shot learning, to other languages by making surprisingly effective use of multi-lingual embeddings. The proposed system has strong empirical evidence yielding state-of-the-art results in English as well as cross-lingual: Spanish and Chinese TAC 2015 datasets.},

abstract = {We present a gradient-tree-boosting-based structured learning model for jointly disambiguating named entities in a document. Gradient tree boosting is a widely used machine learning algorithm that underlies many top-performing natural language processing systems. Surprisingly, most works limit the use of gradient tree boosting as a tool for regular classification or regression problems, despite the structured nature of language. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that employs the structured gradient tree boosting (SGTB) algorithm for collective entity disambiguation. By defining global features over previous disambiguation decisions and jointly modeling them with local features, our system is able to produce globally optimized entity assignments for mentions in a document. Exact inference is prohibitively expensive for our globally normalized model. To solve this problem, we propose Bidirectional Beam Search with Gold path (BiBSG), an approximate inference algorithm that is a variant of the standard beam search algorithm. BiBSG makes use of global information from both past and future to perform better local search. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that SGTB significantly improves upon published results. Specifically, SGTB outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural system by near 1$\backslash${\%} absolute accuracy on the popular AIDA-CoNLL dataset.},

@article{Zhu2018,
abstract = {With the increasing popularity of large scale Knowledge Graph (KG)s, many applications such as semantic analysis, search and question answering need to link entity mentions in texts to entities in KGs. Because of the polysemy problem in natural language, entity disambiguation is thus a key problem in current research. Existing disambiguation methods have considered entity prominence, context similarity and entity-entity relatedness to discriminate ambiguous entities, which are mainly working on document or paragraph level texts containing rich contextual information, and based on lexical matching for computing context similarity. When meeting short texts containing limited contextual information, such as web queries, questions and tweets, those conventional disambiguation methods are not good at handling single entity mention and measuring context similarity. In order to enhance the performance of disambiguation methods based on context similarity with such short texts, we propose SCSNED method for disambiguation based on semantic similarity between contextual words and informative words of entities in KGs. Specially, we exploit the effectiveness of both knowledge-based and corpus-based semantic similarity methods for entity disambiguation with SCSNED. Moreover, we propose a Category2Vec embedding model based on joint learning of word and category embedding, in order to compute word-category similarity for entity disambiguation. We show the effectiveness of these proposed methods with illustrative examples, and evaluate their effectiveness in a comparative experiment for entity disambiguation in real world web queries, questions and tweets. The experimental results have identified the effectiveness of different semantic similarity methods, and demonstrated the improvement of semantic similarity methods in SCSNED and Category2Vec over the conventional context similarity baseline. We further compare the proposed approaches with the state of the art entity disambiguation systems and show the performances of the proposed approaches are among the best performing systems. In addition, one important feature of the proposed approaches using semantic similarity, is the potential application on any existing KGs since they mainly use common features of entity descriptions and categories. Another contribution of the paper is an updated survey on background of entity disambiguation in KGs and semantic similarity methods.},

Large scale experiments on Freebase and a Wikipedia/NY Times corpus show that jointly embedding brings promising improvement in the accuracy of predicting facts, compared to separately embedding knowledge graphs and text. Particularly, jointly embedding enables the prediction of facts containing entities out of the knowledge graph, which cannot be han- dled by previous embedding methods. At the same time, concerning the quality of the word embeddings, experiments on the analogical reasoning task showthat jointly embedding is comparable to or slightly better than word2vec (Skip-Gram).},

It finds its application in the extraction of structured data in RDF (Resource Description Framework) from textual documents, but equally so in facilitating artificial intelligence applications, such as Semantic Search, Reasoning and Question {\&} Answering. In this work, we propose DoSeR (Disambiguation of Semantic Resources), a (named) entity disambiguation framework that is knowledge-base-agnostic in terms of RDF (e.g. DBpedia) and entity-annotated document knowledge bases (e.g. Wikipedia). Initially, our framework automatically generates semantic entity embeddings given one or multiple knowledge bases. In the following, DoSeR accepts documents with a given set of surface forms as input and collectively links them to an entity in a knowledge base with a graph-based approach. We evaluate DoSeR on seven different data sets against publicly available, state-of-the-art (named) entity disambiguation frameworks. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches that make use of RDF knowledge bases and/or entity-annotated document knowledge bases by up to 10 {\%} F1 measure.},

abstract = {The need to bridge between the unstructured data on the Document Web and the structured data on the Web of Data has led to the development of a considerable number of annotation tools. However, these tools are currently still hard to compare since the published evaluation results are calculated on diverse datasets and evaluated based on different measures. We present GERBIL, an evaluation framework for semantic entity annotation. The rationale behind our framework is to provide developers, end users and researchers with easy-to-use interfaces that allow for the agile, fine-grained and uniform evaluation of annotation tools on multiple datasets. By these means, we aim to ensure that both tool developers and end users can derive meaningful insights pertaining to the extension, integration and use of annotation applications. In particular, GERBIL provides comparable results to tool developers so as to allow them to easily discover the strengths and weaknesses of their implementations with respect to the state of the art. With the permanent experiment URIs provided by our framework, we ensure the reproducibility and archiving of evaluation results. Moreover, the framework generates data in machineprocessable format, allowing for the efficient querying and post-processing of evaluation results. Finally, the tool diagnostics provided by GERBIL allows deriving insights pertaining to the areas in which tools should be further refined, thus allowing developers to create an informed agenda for extensions and end users to detect the right tools for their purposes. GERBIL aims to become a focal point for the state of the art, driving the research agenda of the community by presenting comparable objective evaluation results.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel entity annotator for texts which hinges on Tagme's algorithmic technology, currently the best one available [6, 4]. The novelty is twofold: from the one hand, we have engineered the software in order to be modular and more efficient; from the other hand, we have improved the annotation pipeline by re-designing all of its three main modules: spotting, disambiguation and pruning. In particular, the re-design has involved the detailed inspection of the performance of these modules by developing new algorithms which have been in turn tested over all publicly available datasets (i.e. AIDA, IITB, MSN, AQUAINT, and the one of the ERD Challenge). This extensive experimentation allowed us to derive the best combination which achieved on the ERD development dataset an F1 score of 74.8{\%}, which turned to be 67.2{\%} F1 for the test dataset. This final result was due to an impressive precision equal to 87.6{\%}, but very low recall 54.5{\%}. With respect to classic Tagme on the development dataset the improvement ranged from 1{\%} to 9{\%} on the D2W benchmark, depending on the disambiguation algorithm being used. As a side result, the final software can be interpreted as a flexible library of several parsing/disambiguation and pruning modules that can be used to build up new and more sophisticated entity annotators. We plan to release our library to the public as an open-source project.},

@inproceedings{Yamada2014a,
abstract = {When we encounter an interesting entity (e.g., a person's name or a geographic location) while reading text, we typically search and retrieve relevant information about it. Entity linking (EL) is the task of linking entities in a text to the corresponding entries in a knowledge base, such as Wikipedia. Recently, EL has received considerable attention. EL can be used to enhance a user's text reading experience by streamlining the process of retrieving information on entities. Several EL methods have been proposed, though they tend to extract all of the entities in a document including unnecessary ones for users. Excessive linking of entities can be distracting and degrade the user experience. In this paper, we propose a new method for evaluating the helpfulness of linking entities to users. We address this task using supervised machine-learning with a broad set of features. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods by approximately 5.7{\%}-12{\%} F1. In addition, we propose an application, Linkify, which enables developers to integrate EL easily into their web sites.},

@article{Burdick2016,
abstract = {We introduce and develop a declarative framework for entity linking and, in particular, for entity resolution. As in some earlier approaches, our framework is based on a systematic use of constraints. However, the constraints we adopt are link-to-source constraints, unlike in earlier approaches where source-to-link constraints were used to dictate how to generate links. Our approach makes it possible to focus entirely on the intended properties of the outcome of entity linking, thus separating the constraints from any procedure of how to achieve that outcome. The core language consists of link-to-source constraints that specify the desired properties of a link relation in terms of source relations and built-in predicates such as similarity measures. A key feature of the link-to-source constraints is that they employ disjunction, which enables the declarative listing of all the reasons two entities should be linked. We also consider extensions of the core language that capture collective entity resolution by allowing interdependencies among the link relations.

We identify a class of “good” solutions for entity-linking specifications, which we call maximum-value solutions and which capture the strength of a link by counting the reasons that justify it. We study natural algorithmic problems associated with these solutions, including the problem of enumerating the “good” solutions and the problem of finding the certain links, which are the links that appear in every “good” solution. We show that these problems are tractable for the core language but may become intractable once we allow interdependencies among the link relations. We also make some surprising connections between our declarative framework, which is deterministic, and probabilistic approaches such as ones based on Markov Logic Networks.},

@article{Ganea2015a,
abstract = {The goal of entity linking is to map spans of text to canonical entity representations such as Freebase entries or Wikipedia articles. It provides a foundation for various natural language processing tasks, including text understanding, summarization and machine translation. Name ambiguity, word polysemy, context dependencies, and a heavy-tailed distribution of entities contribute to the complexity of this problem. We propose a simple, yet effective, probabilistic graphical model for collective entity linking, which resolves entity links jointly across an entire document. Our model captures local information from linkable token spans (i.e., mentions) and their surrounding context and combines it with a document-level prior of entity co-occurrences. The model is acquired automatically from entity-linked text repositories with a lightweight computational step for parameter adaptation. Loopy belief propagation is used as an efficient approximate inference algorithm. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, our model is conceptually simple and easy to reproduce. It comes with a small memory footprint and is sufficiently fast for real-time usage. We demonstrate its benefits on a wide range of well-known entity linking benchmark datasets. Our empirical results show the merits of the proposed approach and its competitiveness in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.},

The models utilize information about single terms in the query and documents as well as term sequences marked as entities by some entity-linking tool. The key principle of the language models is accounting, simultaneously, for the uncertainty inherent in the entity-markup process and the balance between using entity-based and term-based information. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the merits of using the language models for retrieval. For example, the performance transcends that of a state-of-the-art term proximity method.

@article{Cornolti2016,
abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of linking open-domain web-search queries towards entities drawn from the full entity inventory of Wikipedia articles. We introduce SMAPH-2, a second-order approach that, by piggybacking on a web search engine, alleviates the noise and irregularities that characterize the language of queries and puts queries in a larger context in which it is easier to make sense of them. The key algorithmic idea underlying SMAPH-2 is to first discover a candidate set of entities and then link-back those entities to their mentions occurring in the input query. This allows us to confine the possible concepts pertinent to the query to only the ones really mentioned in it. The link-back is implemented via a collective disambiguation step based upon a supervised ranking model that makes one joint prediction for the annotation of the complete query optimizing directly the F1 measure. We evaluate both known features, such as word embeddings and semantic relatedness among entities, and several novel features such as an approximate distance between mentions and entities (which can handle spelling errors). We demonstrate that SMAPH-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ERD@SIGIR2014 benchmark. We also publish GERDAQ (General Entity Recognition, Disambiguation and Annotation in Queries), a novel, public dataset built specifically for web-query entity linking via a crowdsourcing effort. SMAPH-2 outperforms the benchmarks by comparable margins also on GERDAQ.},

The main goal of the ERD challenge was to promote research in recognition and disambiguation of entities in unstructured text. Unlike many past entity linking challenges, no mention segmentations were given to the participating systems for a given document. Participants were asked to implement a web service for their system to minimize human involvement during evaluation and to enable measuring the processing times. The challenge has attracted a lot of interest (over 100 teams registered, and 27 of those submitted final results). In this paper we cover the task definition, issues encountered during annotation, and provide a detailed analysis of all the participating systems. Specifically, we show how we adapted the pooling technique to address the difficulties of gathering annotations for the entity linking task. We also summarize the ERD workshop that followed the challenge, including the oral and poster presentations as well as the invited talks.},

State-of-the-art approaches rely on lexical and statistical features which are abundant for popular entities but sparse for unpopular ones, resulting in a clear bias towards popular entities and poor accuracy for less popular ones. In this work, we present a novel approach that is guided by a natural notion of semantic similarity which is less amenable to such bias. We adopt a unified semantic representation for entities and documents - the probability distribution obtained from a random walk on a subgraph of the knowledge base - which can overcome the feature sparsity issue that affects previous work. Our algorithm continuously updates the semantic signature of the document as mentions are disambiguated, thus focusing the search based on context. Our experimental evaluation uses well-known benchmarks and different samples of a Wikipedia-based benchmark with varying entity popularity; the results illustrate well the bias of previous methods and the superiority of our approach, especially for the less popular entities.},

abstract = {Entity linking deals with identifying entities from a knowledge base in a given piece of text and has become a fundamental building block for web search engines, enabling numerous downstream improvements from better document ranking to enhanced search results pages. A key problem in the context of web search queries is that this process needs to run under severe time constraints as it has to be performed before any actual retrieval takes place, typically within milliseconds. In this paper we propose a probabilistic model that leverages user-generated information on the web to link queries to entities in a knowledge base. There are three key ingredients that make the algorithm fast and space-efficient. First, the linking process ignores any dependencies between the different entity candidates, which allows for a O(k2) implementation in the number of query terms. Second, we leverage hashing and compression techniques to reduce the memory footprint. Finally, to equip the algorithm with contextual knowledge without sacrificing speed, we factor the distance between distributional semantics of the query words and entities into the model. We show that our solution significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines by more than 14{\%} while being able to process queries in sub-millisecond times---at least two orders of magnitude faster than existing systems.},

abstract = {Combining information extraction systems yields significantly higher quality resources than each system in isolation. In this paper, we generalize such a mixing of sources and features in a framework called Ensemble Semantics. We show very large gains in entity extraction by combining state-of-the-art distributional and pattern-based systems with a large set of features from a webcrawl, query logs, and Wikipedia. Experimental results on a web-scale extraction of actors, athletes and musicians show significantly higher mean average precision scores (29{\%} gain) compared with the current state of the art.},

@article{Berlanga2014,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for semantic annotation and search of a target corpus using several knowledge resources (KRs). This method relies on a formal statistical framework in which KR concepts and corpus documents are homogeneously represented using statistical language models. Under this framework, we can perform all the necessary operations for an efficient and effective semantic annotation of the corpus. Firstly, we propose a coarse tailoring of the KRs w.r.t the target corpus with the main goal of reducing the ambiguity of the annotations and their computational overhead. Then, we propose the generation of concept profiles, which allow measuring the semantic overlap of the KRs as well as performing a finer tailoring of them. Finally, we propose how to semantically represent documents and queries in terms of the KRs concepts and the statistical framework to perform semantic search. Experiments have been carried out with a corpus about web resources which includes several Life Sciences catalogs and Wikipedia pages related to web resources in general (e.g., databases, tools, services, etc.). Results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art methods relying on either context-free annotation or keyword-based search.},

Users through their activities on these networks are leaving traces of their expertise, interests and personalities. With the advances in Web mining and user modeling techniques it is possible to leverage the user social network activity history to extract the semantics of user-generated content. In this work we explore various techniques for constructing user profiles based on the content they publish on social networks. We further show that one of the advantages of maintaining social network user profiles is to provide the context for better understanding of microposts. We propose and experimentally evaluate different approaches for entity disambiguation in social networks based on syntactic and semantic features on top of two different social networks: a general-interest network (i.e., Twitter) and a domain-specific network (i.e., StackOverflow). We demonstrate how disambiguation accuracy increases when considering enriched user profiles integrating content from both social networks.},

abstract = {Entity ranking has recently emerged as a research field that aims at retrieving entities as answers to a query. Unlike entity extraction where the goal is to tag names of entities in documents, entity ranking is primarily focused on returning a ranked list of relevant entity names for the query. Many approaches to entity ranking have been proposed, and most of them were evaluated on the INEX Wikipedia test collection. In this paper, we describe a system we developed for ranking Wikipedia entities in answer to a query. The entity ranking approach implemented in our system utilises the known categories, the link structure of Wikipedia, as well as the link co-occurrences with the entity examples (when provided) to retrieve relevant entities as answers to the query. We also extend our entity ranking approach by utilising the knowledge of predicted classes of topic difficulty. To predict the topic difficulty, we generate a classifier that uses features extracted from an INEX topic definition to classify the topic into an experimentally predetermined class. This knowledge is then utilised to dynamically set the optimal values for the retrieval parameters of our entity ranking system. Our experiments demonstrate that the use of categories and the link structure of Wikipedia can significantly improve entity ranking effectiveness, and that topic difficulty prediction is a promising approach that could also be exploited to further improve the entity ranking performance.},

abstract = {Integrating the extracted facts with an existing knowledge base has raised an urgent need to address the problem of entity linking. Specifically, entity linking is the task to link the entity mention in text with the corresponding real world entity in the existing knowledge base. However, this task is challenging due to name ambiguity, textual inconsistency, and lack of world knowledge in the knowledge base. Several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, but they are largely based on the co-occurrence statistics of terms between the text around the entity mention and the document associated with the entity. In this paper, we propose LINDEN, a novel framework to link named entities in text with a knowledge base unifying Wikipedia and WordNet, by leveraging the rich semantic knowledge embedded in the Wikipedia and the taxonomy of the knowledge base. We extensively evaluate the performance of our proposed LINDEN over two public data sets and empirical results show that LINDEN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy.},

Our solution bootstraps from small seed input knowledge to discover relevant query templates, by harnessing the wealth of information available in search logs. We model this information in a tri-partite QueST network of queries, sites, and templates. We propose a probabilistic inferencing framework based on the dual metrics of precision and recall- and we show that the dual inferencing correspond respectively to the random walks in backward and forward directions. We deployed and tested our algorithm over a real-world search log of 15 million queries. The algorithm achieved accuracy of as high as 90{\%} (on F-measure), with little seed knowledge and even with incomplete domain schema.},

abstract = {We propose methods for estimating the probability that an entity from an entity database is associated with a web search query. Association is modeled using a query entity click graph, blending general query click logs with vertical query click logs. Smoothing techniques are proposed to address the inherent data sparsity in such graphs, including interpolation using a query synonymy model. A large-scale empirical analysis of the smoothing techniques, over a 2-year click graph collected from a commercial search engine, shows significant reductions in modeling error. The association models are then applied to the task of recommending products to web queries, by annotating queries with products from a large catalog and then mining query-product associations through web search session analysis. Experimental analysis shows that our smoothing techniques improve coverage while keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-performing model affects 9{\%} of general web queries with 94{\%} precision.},

Previous ap- proaches to D2W focused on the use of lo- cal and global statistics over the given text, Wikipedia articles and its link structures, to evaluate context compatibility among a list of probable candidates. However, these meth- ods fail (often, embarrassingly), when some level of text understanding is needed to sup- port Wikification. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to Wikification by incorpo- rating, along with statistical methods, richer relational analysis of the text. We provide an extensible, efficient and modular Integer Lin- ear Programming (ILP) formulation of Wik- ification that incorporates the entity-relation inference problem, and show that the ability to identify relations in text helps both candi- date generation and ranking Wikipedia titles considerably. Our results show significant im- provements in both Wikification and the TAC Entity Linking task.},

Existing approaches typically perform these two steps using a pipeline architecture: they use a NamedEntity Recognition (NER) system to ﬁnd the boundaries of mentions in text, and an Entity Linking (EL) system to connect the mentions to entries in structured or semi-structured repositories like Wikipedia. However, the two tasks are tightly coupled, and each type of system can beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from the kind of information provided by the other. We present a joint model for NER and EL, called NEREL, that takes a large set of candidate mentions from typical NER systems and a large set of candidate entity links from EL systems, and ranks the candidate mention-entity pairs together to make joint predictions. In NER and EL experiments across three datasets, NEREL signiﬁcantly outperforms or comes close to the performance of two state-of-the-art NER systems, and it outperforms 6 competing EL systems. On the benchmark MSNBC dataset, NEREL provides a 60{\%} reduction in error over the next-best NER system and a 68{\%} reduction in error over the next-best EL system.},

abstract = {Entity linking is the task of linking names in free text to the referent entities in a knowledge base. Most recently proposed linking systems can be broken down into two steps: candidate generation and candidate ranking. The first step searches candidates from the knowledge base and the second step disambiguates them. Previous works have been focused on the recall of the generation because if the target entity is absent in the candidate set, no ranking method can return the correct result. Most of the recall-driven generation strategies will increase the number of the candidates. However, with large candidate sets, memory/time consuming systems are impractical for online applications. In this paper, we propose a novel candidate generation approach to generate high recall candidate set with small size. Experimental results on two KBP data sets show that the candidate generation recall achieves more than 93{\%}. By leveraging our approach, the candidate number is reduced from hundreds to dozens, the system runtime is saved by 70.3{\%} and 76.6{\%} over the baseline and the highest micro-averaged accuracy in the evaluation is improved by 2.2{\%} and 3.4{\%}.},

abstract = {Named entity disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentions in natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base such as Wikipedia. Such disambiguation can help enhance readability and add semantics to plain text. It is also a central step in constructing high-quality information network or knowledge graph from unstructured text. Previous research has tackled this problem by making use of various textual and structural features from a knowledge base. Most of the proposed algorithms assume that a knowledge base can provide enough explicit and useful information to help disambiguate a mention to the right entity. However, the existing knowledge bases are rarely complete (likely will never be), thus leading to poor performance on short queries with not well-known contexts. In such cases, we need to collect additional evidences scattered in internal and external corpus to augment the knowledge bases and enhance their disambiguation power. In this work, we propose a generative model and an incremental algorithm to automatically mine useful evidences across documents. With a speciﬁc modeling of “background topic” and “unknown entities”, our model is able to harvest useful evidences out of noisy information. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly: boosting the disambiguation accuracy from 43{\%} (baseline) to 86{\%} on short queries derived from tweets.},

Our approach differs from other recently proposed entity resolution approaches in that it is a) generative, b) does not make pair-wise decisions and c) captures relations between entities through a hidden group variable. We propose a novel sampling algorithm for collective entity resolution which is unsupervised and also takes entity relations into account. Additionally, we do not assume the domain of entities to be known and show how to infer the number of entities from the data. We demonstrate the utility and practicality of our relational entity resolution approach for author resolution in two real-world bibliographic datasets.

The aim is to automatically identify meaningful and relevant hypertext links between documents in different languages. This is particularly helpful in knowledge discovery if a multi-lingual knowledge base is sparse in one language or another, or the topical coverage in each language is different; such is the case with the Wikipedia. Techniques for identifying new and topically relevant cross-lingual links are a current topic of interest at NTCIR where the CrossLink task has been running since the 2011 NTCIR-9. This paper presents the evaluation framework for benchmarking algorithms for cross-lingual link discovery evaluated in the context of NTCIR-9. This framework includes topics, document collections, assessments, metrics, and a toolkit for pooling, assessment, and evaluation. The assessments are further divided into two separate sets: manual assessments performed by human assessors; and automatic assessments based on links extracted from the Wikipedia itself. Using this framework we show that manual assessment is more robust than automatic assessment in the context of cross-lingual link discovery.},

abstract = {Information extraction on microblog posts is an important task nowadays, as microblogs capture an unprecedented amount of information and provide a view into the pulse of the world. Given that the current definition of named entity recognition is too limited, we consider the task of Twitter entity linking in this paper. In the current entity linking literature, mention detection and entity disambiguation are frequently cast as equally important but distinct problems. However, in our task, we find that mention detection is often the performance bottleneck. The reason is that messages on micro-blogs are short, noisy, and informal texts with little context, and often contain phrases with ambiguous meanings. To rigorously address the Twitter entity linking problem, we propose a structural SVM algorithm for entity linking that jointly optimizes mention detection and entity disambiguation as a single end-to-end task. By combining structural learning and a variety of firstorder, second-order, and context-sensitive features, our system is able to outperform existing state-of-the art entity linking systems by 15{\%} F1.},

Knowledge base acceleration (KBA) systems seek to help humans expand knowledge bases like Wikipedia by automatically recommending edits based on incoming content streams. A core step in this process is that of identifying relevant content, i.e., ﬁltering documents that would imply modiﬁcations to the attributes or relations of a given target entity. We propose two multi-step classiﬁcation approaches for this task that consist of two and three binary classi- ﬁcation steps, respectively. Both methods share the same initial component, which is concerned with the identiﬁcation of entity mentions in documents, while subsequent steps involve identiﬁcation of documents being relevant and/or central to a given entity. Using the evaluation platform of the TREC 2012 KBA track and a rich feature set developed for this particular task, we show that both approaches deliver state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract = {We tackle the problems of semiautomatically matching linked data sets and of linking large collections of Web pages to linked data. Our system, ZenCrowd, (1) uses a three-stage blocking technique in order to obtain the best possible instance matches while minimizing both computational complexity and latency, and (2) identifies entities from natural language text using state-of-the-art techniques and automatically connects them to the linked open data cloud. First, we use structured inverted indices to quickly find potential candidate results from entities that have been indexed in our system. Our system then analyzes the candidate matches and refines them whenever deemed necessary using computationally more expensive queries on a graph database. Finally, we resort to human computation by dynamically generating crowdsourcing tasks in case the algorithmic components fail to come up with convincing results. We integrate all results from the inverted indices, from the graph database and from the crowd using a probabilistic framework in order to make sensible decisions about candidate matches and to identify unreliable human workers. In the following, we give an overview of the architecture of our system and describe in detail our novel three-stage blocking technique and our probabilistic decision framework. We also report on a series of experimental results on a standard data set, showing that our system can achieve a 95 {\%} average accuracy on instance matching (as compared to the initial 88 {\%} average accuracy of the purely automatic baseline) while drastically limiting the amount of work performed by the crowd. The experimental evaluation of our system on the entity linking task shows an average relative improvement of 14 {\%} over our best automatic approach.},

abstract = {Using semantic technologies for mining and intelligent information access to microblogs is a challenging, emerging research area. Unlike carefully authored news text and other longer content, tweets pose a number of new challenges, due to their short, noisy, context-dependent, and dynamic nature. Semantic annotation of tweets is typically performed in a pipeline, comprising successive stages of language identification, tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and entity disambiguation (e.g. with respect to DBpedia). Consequently, errors are cumulative, and earlier-stage problems can severely reduce the performance of final stages. This paper presents a characterisation of genre-specific problems at each semantic annotation stage and the impact on subsequent stages. Critically, we evaluate impact on two high-level semantic annotation tasks: named entity detection and disambiguation. Our results demonstrate the importance of making approaches specific to the genre, and indicate a diminishing returns effect that reduces the effectiveness of complex text normalisation.},

For example, given a query for a specific flashlight, we aim to present actions such as reading reviews, watching demo videos, and finding the best price online. In an annotation study conducted over a random sample of user query sessions, we found that a large proportion of queries in query logs involve actions on entities, calling for an automatic approach to identifying relevant actions for entity-bearing queries. In this paper, we pose the problem of finding actions that can be performed on entities as the problem of probabilistic inference in a graphical model that captures how an entity bearing query is generated. We design models of increasing complexity that capture latent factors such as entity type and intended actions that determine how a user writes a query in a search box, and the URL that they click on. Given a large collection of real-world queries and clicks from a commercial search engine, the models are learned efficiently through maximum likelihood estimation using an EM algorithm. Given a new query, probabilistic inference enables recommendation of a set of pertinent actions and hosts. We propose an evaluation methodology for measuring the relevance of our recommended actions, and show empirical evidence of the quality and the diversity of the discovered actions.},

This is a major problem in areas like information retrieval or knowledge management, for example when searching for a specific entity or updating an existing knowledge base. We approach this problem of named entity disambiguation (NED) using thematic information derived from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to compare the entity mention's context with candidate entities in Wikipedia represented by their respective articles. We evaluate various distances over topic distributions in a supervised classification setting to find the best suited candidate entity, which is either covered in Wikipedia or unknown. We compare our approach to a state of the art method and show that it achieves significantly better results in predictive performance, regarding both entities covered in Wikipedia as well as uncovered entities. We show that our approach is in general language independent as we obtain equally good results for named entity disambiguation using the English, the German and the French Wikipedia.},

abstract = {Entity Linking (EL) has received considerable attention in recent years. Given many name mentions in a document, the goal of EL is to predict their referent entities in a knowledge base. Traditionally, there have been two distinct directions of EL research: one focusing on the effects of mention's context compatibility, assuming that "the referent entity of a mention is reflected by its context"; the other dealing with the effects of document's topic coherence, assuming that "a mention's referent entity should be coherent with the document's main topics". In this paper, we propose a generative model -- called entity-topic model, to effectively join the above two complementary directions together. By jointly modeling and exploiting the context compatibility, the topic coherence and the correlation between them, our model can accurately link all mentions in a document using both the local information (including the words and the mentions in a document) and the global knowledge (including the topic knowledge, the entity context knowledge and the entity name knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Entity Linking (EL) is the task of linking name mentions in Web text with their referent entities in a knowledge base. Traditional EL methods usually link name mentions in a document by assuming them to be independent. However, there is often additional interdependence between different EL decisions, i.e., the entities in the same document should be semantically related to each other. In these cases, Collective Entity Linking, in which the name mentions in the same document are linked jointly by exploiting the interdependence between them, can improve the entity linking accuracy. This paper proposes a graph-based collective EL method, which can model and exploit the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based representation, called Referent Graph, which can model the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Then we propose a collective inference algorithm, which can jointly infer the referent entities of all name mentions by exploiting the interdependence captured in Referent Graph. The key benefit of our method comes from: 1) The global interdependence model of EL decisions; 2) The purely collective nature of the inference algorithm, in which evidence for related EL decisions can be reinforced into high-probability decisions. Experimental results show that our method can achieve significant performance improvement over the traditional EL methods.},

abstract = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction and aims to identify atomic entities in text that fall into predefined categories such as person, location, organization, etc. Recent efforts in NER try to extract entities and link them to linked data entities. Linked data is a term used for data resources that are created using semantic web standards such as DBpedia. There are a number of online tools that try to identify named entities in text and link them to linked data resources. Although one can use these tools via their APIs and web interfaces, they use different data resources and different techniques to identify named entities and not all of them reveal this information. One of the major tasks in NER is disambiguation that is identifying the right entity among a number of entities with the same names; for example "apple" standing for both "Apple, Inc." the company and the fruit. We developed a similar tool called NERSO, short for Named Entity Recognition Using Semantic Open Data, to automatically extract named entities, disambiguating and linking them to DBpedia entities. Our disambiguation method is based on constructing a graph of linked data entities and scoring them using a graph-based centrality algorithm. We evaluate our system by comparing its performance with two publicly available NER tools. The results show that NERSO performs better. 2012 ACM.},

We also introduced two new tasks - (1) Cross-lingual Entity Linking: Given a set of multi-lingual (English and Chinese) queries, the system is required to provide the ID of the English KB entry to which each query refers and cluster NIL queries without KB references; and (2) Temporal Slot Filling: given an entity query, the system is required to discover the start and end dates for any identiﬁed slot ﬁll. KBP2011 has attracted many participants (over 65 teams registered, among which 35 teams submitted results). In this paper we provide an overview of the task deﬁnition, annotation issues, successful methods and research challenges associated with each task in KBP2011.},

abstract = {In this paper we give an overview of the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track at TAC 2010. The main goal of KBP is to promote research in discovering facts about entities and expanding a structured knowledge base with this information. A large source collection of newswire and web documents is provided for systems to discover information. Attributes (a.k.a. “slots”) derived from Wikipedia infoboxes are used to create the reference knowledge base (KB). KBP2010 includes the following four tasks: (1) Regular Entity Linking, where names must be aligned to entities in the KB; (2) Optional Entity linking, without using Wikipedia texts; (3) Regular Slot Filling, which requires a system to automatically discover the attributes of specified entities from the source document collection and use them to expand the KB; (4) Surprise Slot Filling, which requires a system to return answers regarding new slot types within a short time period. KBP2010 has attracted many participants (over 45 teams registered for KBP 2010 (not including the RTEKBP Validation Pilot task), among which 23 teams submitted results). In this paper we provide an overview of the task definition and annotation challenges associated with KBP2010. Then we summarize the evaluation results and discuss the lessons that we have learned based on detailed analysis.},

abstract = {We address the Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) problem for short, user-generated texts on the social Web. In such settings, the lack of linguistic features and sparse lexical context result in a high degree of ambiguity and sharp performance drops of nearly 50{\%} in the accuracy of conventional NED systems. We handle these challenges by developing a model of user-interest with respect to a personal knowledge context; and Wikipedia, a particularly well-established and reliable knowledge base, is used to instantiate the procedure. We conduct systematic evaluations using individuals' posts from Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr and demonstrate that our novel technique is able to achieve substantial performance gains beyond state-of-the-art NED methods.},

abstract = {Text annotation is the procedure of initially identifying, in a segment of text, a set of dominant in meaning words and later on attaching to them extra information (usually drawn from a concept ontology, implemented as a catalog) that expresses their conceptual content in the current context. Attaching additional semantic information and structure helps to represent, in a machine interpretable way, the topic of the text and is a fundamental preprocessing step to many Information Retrieval tasks like indexing, clustering, classification, text summarization and cross-referencing content on web pages, posts, tweets etc. In this paper, we deal with automatic annotation of text documents with entities of Wikipedia, the largest online knowledge base; a process that is commonly known as Wikification. Moving similarly to previous approaches the cross-reference of words in the text to Wikipedia articles is based on local compatibility between the text around the term and textual information embedded in the article. The main contribution of this paper is a set of disambiguation techniques that enhance previously published approaches by employing both the WordNet lexical database and the Wikipedia article's PageRank scores in the disambiguation process. The experimental evaluation performed depicts that the exploitation of these additional semantic information sources leads to more accurate Text Annotation.},

Most previous work has focused on linking terms in formal texts (e.g. newswire) to Wikipedia. Linking terms in short informal texts (e.g. tweets) is difﬁcult for systems and humans alike as they lack a rich disambiguation context. We ﬁrst evaluate an existing Twitter dataset as well as the D2W task in general. We then test the effects of two tweet context expansion methods, based on tweet authorship and topic-based clustering, on a state-of-the-art D2W system and evaluate the results.},

abstract = {Using semantic technologies for mining and intelligent information access to microblogs is a challenging, emerging research area. Unlike carefully authored news text and other longer content, tweets pose a number of new challenges, due to their short, noisy, context-dependent, and dynamic nature. Semantic annotation of tweets is typically performed in a pipeline, comprising successive stages of language identification, tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and entity disambiguation (e.g. with respect to DBpedia). Consequently, errors are cumulative, and earlier-stage problems can severely reduce the performance of final stages. This paper presents a characterisation of genre-specific problems at each semantic annotation stage and the impact on subsequent stages. Critically, we evaluate impact on two high-level semantic annotation tasks: named entity detection and disambiguation. Our results demonstrate the importance of making approaches specific to the genre, and indicate a diminishing returns effect that reduces the effectiveness of complex text normalisation.},

abstract = {Entity disambiguation with a knowledge base becomes increasingly popular in the NLP community. In this paper, we employ Freebase as the knowledge base, which contains significantly more entities than Wikipedia and others. While huge in size, Freebase lacks context for most entities, such as the descriptive text and hyperlinks in Wikipedia, which are useful for disambiguation. Instead, we leverage two features of Freebase, namely the naturally disambiguated mention phrases (aka aliases) and the rich taxonomy, to perform disambiguation in an iterative manner. Specifically, we explore both generative and discriminative models for each iteration. Experiments on 2, 430, 707 English sentences and 33, 743 Freebase entities show the effectiveness of the two features, where 90{\%} accuracy can be reached without any labeled data. We also show that discriminative models with proposed split training strategy is robust against over fitting problem, and constantly outperforms the generative ones.},

abstract = {Automatically discovering cross-lingual links (CLs) between wikis can largely enrich the cross-lingual knowledge and facilitate knowledge sharing across different languages. In most existing approaches for cross-lingual knowledge linking, the seed CLs and the inner link structures are two important factors for ﬁnding new CLs. When there are insufﬁcient seed CLs and inner links, discovering new CLs becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an approach that boosts cross-lingual knowledge linking by concept annotation. Given a small number of seed CLs and inner links, our approach ﬁrst enriches the inner links in wikis by using concept annotation method, and then predicts new CLs with a regression-based learning model. These two steps mutually reinforce each other, and are executed iteratively to ﬁnd as many CLs as possible. Experimental results on the English and Chinese Wikipedia data show that the concept annotation can effectively improve the quantity and quality of predicted CLs. With 50,000 seed CLs and 30{\%} of the original inner links in Wikipedia, our approach discovered 171,393 more CLs in four runs when using concept annotation.},

Our content-based approach can be used even for previously unseen pages. We represent the topics of a page by the set of Wikipedia entities extracted from it. To obtain useful query suggestions for these entities, we exploit a novel graph model that we call EQGraph (Entity-Query Graph), containing entities, queries, and transitions between entities, between queries, as well as from entities to queries. We perform Personalized PageRank computation on such a graph to expand the set of entities extracted from a page into a richer set of entities, and to associate these entities with relevant query suggestions. We develop an efficient implementation to deal with large graph instances and suggest queries from a large and diverse pool. We perform a user study that shows that our method produces relevant and interesting recommendations, and outperforms an alternative method based on reverse IR.},

Streams of microblogs are of great value because of their direct and real-time nature. Determining what an individual microblog post is about, however, can be non-trivial because of creative language usage, the highly contextualized and informal nature of microblog posts, and the limited length of this form of communication. We propose a solution to the problem of determining what a microblog post is about through semantic linking: we add semantics to posts by automatically identifying concepts that are semantically related to it and generating links to the corresponding Wikipedia articles. The identified concepts can subsequently be used for, e.g., social media mining, thereby reducing the need for manual inspection and selection. Using a purpose-built test collection of tweets, we show that recently proposed approaches for semantic linking do not perform well, mainly due to the idiosyncratic nature of microblog posts. We propose a novel method based on machine learning with a set of innovative features and show that it is able to achieve significant improvements over all other methods, especially in terms of precision.},

abstract = {The semantic knowledge of Wikipedia has proved to be useful for many tasks, for example, named entity disambiguation. Among these applications, the task of identifying the word sense based on Wikipedia is a crucial component because the output of this component is often used in subsequent tasks. In this article, we present a two-stage framework (called TSDW) for word sense disambiguation using knowledge latent in Wikipedia. The disambiguation of a given phrase is applied through a two-stage disambiguation process: (a) The first-stage disambiguation explores the contextual semantic information, where the noisy information is pruned for better effectiveness and efficiency; and (b) the second-stage disambiguation explores the disambiguated phrases of high confidence from the first stage to achieve better redisambiguation decisions for the phrases that are difficult to disambiguate in the first stage. Moreover, existing studies have addressed the disambiguation problem for English text only. Considering the popular usage of Wikipedia in different languages, we study the performance of TSDW and the existing state-of-the-art approaches over both English and Traditional Chinese articles. The experimental results show that TSDW generalizes well to different semantic relatedness measures and text in different languages. More important, TSDW significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with both better effectiveness and efficiency.},

They are largely based on local compatibility between the text around the spot and textual metadata associated with the entity. Two recent systems exploit inter-label dependencies, but in limited ways. We propose a general collective disambiguation approach. Our premise is that coherent documents refer to entities from one or a few related topics or domains. We give formulations for the trade-off between local spot-to-entity compatibility and measures of global coherence between entities. Optimizing the overall entity assignment is NP-hard. We investigate practical solutions based on local hill-climbing, rounding integer linear programs, and pre-clustering entities followed by local optimization within clusters. In experiments involving over a hundred manually-annotated Web pages and tens of thousands of spots, our approaches significantly outperform recently-proposed algorithms.},

In our model, each name mention to be linked is modeled as a sample generated through a three-step generative story, and the entity knowledge is encoded in the distribution of entities in document P(e), the distribution of possible names of a specific entity P(s$\backslash$e), and the distribution of possible contexts of a specific entity P(c$\backslash$e).

Secondly, as entity linking annotation is expensive and labor intensive, to automate the annotation process without compromise of accuracy, we propose an instance selection strategy to effectively utilize the automatically generated annotation. In our selection strategy, an informative and diverse set of instances are selected for effective disambiguation. Lastly, topic modeling is used to model the semantic topics of the articles.

abstract = {This paper address the problem of entity linking. Specifically, given an entity mentioned in unstructured texts, the task is to link this entity with an entry stored in the existing knowledge base. This is an important task for information extraction. It can serve as a convenient gateway to encyclopedic information, and can greatly improve the web users' experience. Previous learning based solutions mainly focus on classification framework. However, it's more suitable to consider it as a ranking problem. In this paper, we propose a learning to rank algorithm for entity linking. It effectively utilizes the relationship information among the candidates when ranking. The experiment results on the TAC 2009 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The proposed method achieves 18.5{\%} improvement in terms of accuracy over the classification models for those entities which have corresponding entries in the Knowledge Base. The overall performance of the system is also better than that of the state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we propose to use additional information sources from Wikipedia to find more name variations for entity linking task. In addition, as manually creating a training corpus for entity linking is laborintensive and costly, we present a novel method to automatically generate a large scale corpus annotation for ambiguous mentions leveraging on their unambiguous synonyms in the document collection. Then, a binary classifier is trained to filter out KB entities that are not similar to current mentions. This classifier not only can effectively reduce the ambiguities to the existing entities in KB, but also be very useful to highlight the new entities to KB for the further population. Furthermore, we also leverage on the Wikipedia documents to provide additional information which is not available in our generated corpus through a domain adaption approach which provides further performance improvements.

Keyphrases are mainly derived from Wikipedia article titles and anchor texts associated with wikilinks. The disambiguation of a given keyphrase is based on both the commonness of a candidate topic and the context-dependent relatedness where unnecessary (and potentially noisy) context information is pruned.

This paper introduces a new task, called Open-Database Named-Entity Disambiguation (Open-DB NED), in which a system must be able to resolve named entities to symbols in an arbitrary database, without requiring labeled data for each new database. We introduce two techniques for Open-DB NED, one based on distant supervision and the other based on domain adaptation.

Recently, a number of systems have been proposed for linking entity mentions in text to Wikipedia pages. Such systems typically search for candidate entities and then disambiguate them, returning either the best candidate or nil. However, comparison has focused on disambiguation accuracy, making it difficult to determine how search impacts performance. Furthermore, important approaches from the literature have not been systematically compared on standard data sets. We reimplement three seminal nel systems and present a detailed evaluation of search strategies. Our experiments find that coreference and acronym handling lead to substantial improvement, and search strategies account for much of the variation between systems. This is an interesting finding, because these aspects of the problem have often been neglected in the literature, which has focused largely on complex candidate ranking algorithms.},

abstract = {Name ambiguity problem has raised an urgent demand for efficient, high-quality named entity disambiguation methods. The key problem of named entity disambiguation is to measure the similarity between occurrences of names. The traditional methods measure the similarity using the bag of words (BOW) model. The BOW, however, ignores all the semantic relations such as social relatedness between named entities, associative relatedness between concepts, polysemy and synonymy between key terms. So the BOW cannot reflect the actual similarity. Some research has investigated social networks as background knowledge for disambiguation. Social networks, however, can only capture the social relatedness between named entities, and often suffer the limited coverage problem. To overcome the previous methods' deficiencies, this paper proposes to use Wikipedia as the background knowledge for disambiguation, which surpasses other knowledge bases by the coverage of concepts, rich semantic information and up-to-date content. By leveraging Wikipedia's semantic knowledge like social relatedness between named entities and associative relatedness between concepts, we can measure the similarity between occurrences of names more accurately. In particular, we construct a large-scale semantic network from Wikipedia, in order that the semantic knowledge can be used efficiently and effectively. Based on the constructed semantic network, a novel similarity measure is proposed to leverage Wikipedia semantic knowledge for disambiguation. The proposed method has been tested on the standard WePS data sets. Empirical results show that the disambiguation performance of our method gets 10.7{\%} improvement over the traditional BOW based methods and 16.7{\%} improvement over the traditional social network based methods.},

In this paper we propose to solve SRC via an innovative approach that consists of modeling the problem as the labeled clustering of the nodes of a newly introduced graph of topics. The topics are Wikipedia-pages identified by means of recently proposed topic annotators [9, 11, 16, 20] applied to the search results, and the edges denote the relatedness among these topics computed by taking into account the linkage of the Wikipedia-graph. We tackle this problem by designing a novel algorithm that exploits the spectral properties and the labels of that graph of topics. We show the superiority of our approach with respect to academic state-of-the-art work [6] and well-known commercial systems (CLUSTY and LINGO3G) by performing an extensive set of experiments on standard datasets and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We test several standard measures for evaluating the performance of all systems and show a relative improvement of up to 20{\%}.},

@inproceedings{Milne2008b,
abstract = {This paper describes how to automatically cross-reference documents with Wikipedia: the largest knowledge base ever known. It explains how machine learning can be used to identify significant terms within unstructured text, and enrich it with links to the appropriate Wikipedia articles. The resulting link detector and disambiguator performs very well, with recall and precision of almost 75{\%}. This performance is constant whether the system is evaluated on Wikipedia articles or "real world" documents. This work has implications far beyond enriching documents with explanatory links. It can provide structured knowledge about any unstructured fragment of text. Any task that is currently addressed with bags of words - indexing, clustering, retrieval, and summarization to name a few - could use the techniques described here to draw on a vast network of concepts and semantics.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new technique for obtaining measures of semantic relatedness. Like other recent approaches, it uses Wikipedia to provide structured world knowledge about the terms of interest. Our approach is unique in that it does so using the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia rather than its category hierarchy or textual content. Evaluation with manually defined measures of semantic relatedness reveals this to be an effective compromise between the ease of computation of the former approach and the accuracy of the latter.},

@inproceedings{CIKM:2007:Mihalcea,
abstract = {This paper introduces the use of Wikipedia as a resource for automatic keyword extraction and word sense disambiguation, and shows how this online encyclopedia can be used to achieve state-of-the-art results on both these tasks. The paper also shows how the two methods can be combined into a system able to automatically enrich a text with links to encyclopedic knowledge. Given an input document, the system identifies the important concepts in the text and automatically links these concepts to the corresponding Wikipedia pages. Evaluations of the system show that the automatic annotations are reliable and hardly distinguishable from manual annotations.},
